# Landslide Detection System Using Satellite Imagery and YOLOv8
This project is developed for a hackathon to address the critical issue of landslide detection in Nepal. Using YOLOv8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, the system automates the identification of landslide-prone areas to enhance disaster response, safeguard transportation, and minimize the impact of landslides.
# Problem Statement
Nepal's mountainous terrain and monsoon rainfall make it highly prone to landslides, leading to road blockages, isolation of communities, and significant damage to infrastructure and lives. Traditional monitoring methods are time-consuming and inefficient, requiring automated solutions for quicker detection and response.
# Project Goals
Automated Detection: Leverage satellite imagery and object detection models to identify landslide-prone areas.
Enhanced Disaster Management: Enable early detection for quicker disaster response and mitigation.
Transportation Safety: Minimize disruptions on roads and highways by timely intervention.
# Technologies Used
Satellite Imagery: Sentinel-2 for detailed terrain and spectral data.
Object Detection: YOLOv8 for efficient and scalable landslide detection.
We used GUI to visualize the data
Programming and Libraries:
Python: For data processing, model training, and detection.
Ultralytics YOLOv8: Implementation of the object detection model.
OpenCV: Image visualization and processing.
Google Earth Engine: Integration for satellite data.
# Data Sources
Sentinel-2 Satellite Data: High-resolution, multispectral imagery.
Historical Landslide Data: For training and validating the detection model.
